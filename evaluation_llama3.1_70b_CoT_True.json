        "response": "To solve this puzzle, let's break down the transformation from Input to Output for Transformation A.\n\n\n## Step 1: Identify the Pattern of Repetition\nThe input is a 2x2 matrix:\n```\n[[8, 6], [6, 4]]\n```\nThe output is a 6x4 matrix. Let's examine how each row of the input transforms into rows in the output.\n\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Row Transformation\nLooking at the transformation from Input to Output for Transformation A:\n- The first and third elements of each row in the input are repeated three times.\n- The second and fourth elements of each row in the input are also repeated but seem to alternate with different values.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we can observe a simpler pattern:\n- Each element in the original 2x2 matrix is simply alternated and repeated.\n\n\n## Step 3: Apply Transformation Logic\nGiven this understanding, let's apply it to Transformation B - Input:\n```\n[[3, 2], [7, 8]]\n```\n\nApplying the observed transformation logic (alternating and repeating each element):\n- The first row of the input [3, 2] transforms into a pattern where 3 and 2 alternate.\n- Similarly, the second row [7, 8] transforms with 7 and 8 alternating.\n\n\nThe final answer is: \n<Matrix>\n[[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]]\n</Matrix>",
