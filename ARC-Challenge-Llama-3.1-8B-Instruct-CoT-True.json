For example <ANSWER>X</ANSWER>.\nThink through the problem step by step.\n\nYou know that producers are organisms that make their own food from sunlight. You have to figure out which of the options is a characteristic of a producer.\nA: It is an organism that cannot make its own food. This is the definition of a consumer, not a producer.\nB: It is an organism that makes its own food from sunlight. This is the correct answer. Producers, such as plants and algae, make their own food from sunlight through the process of photosynthesis.\nC: It is an organism that eats other organisms for energy. This is the definition of a carnivore, not a producer.\nD: It is an organism that eats plants for energy. This is the definition of an herbivore, not a producer.\nThe final answer is <ANSWER>B</ANSWER>.",

The disease passes from one animal to another through bites and is caused by parasites. The parasites cause cancerous tumors that spread throughout an infected animal's body and kill it. What is the best description of DFTD?",
    "response": "The information provided states that DFTD is caused by parasites that are passed from one animal to another through bites, and that it causes cancerous tumors that spread throughout an infected animal's body and kill it. This means that DFTD is an infectious disease, and that it is a cell-cycle disease because it involves the uncontrolled growth of cells. Therefore, the best description of DFTD is an infectious, cell-cycle disease.",

    "response": "You can consider the climate of the western United States, the characteristics of the small mammal, and the likely needs of the mammal during different seasons.\nYou can eliminate choices that do not make sense given the climate and the characteristics of the small mammal.\nYou can consider the likely benefits and drawbacks of each choice.\nYou can choose the most likely reason.\nThe small mammal is likely storing food that will be eaten over the winter months. During the summer, the mammal is able to forage for food easily, but during the winter, the weather may make it difficult to find food. Storing food in protected places in the rock piles would allow the mammal to survive the winter months. The other choices do not make sense given the climate and the characteristics of the small mammal. The mammal is not likely to migrate before winter, as it is a small mammal and is adapted to the mountain regions of the western United States. The rock piles would not provide enough warmth to keep the mammal from freezing during the winter months. The mammal is not likely to be concerned with protecting the grasses and seeds from decay before winter, as the grasses and seeds would not decay quickly in the dry mountain climate.\n<ANSWER>C</ANSWER>",
